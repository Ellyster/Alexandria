# [Alexandria](http://www.alexandria.io/)

#### Presenting [Alexandria](http://www.alexandria.io), a central hub for open access *research papers*.

The *Royal Library of Alexandria*, or *Ancient Library of Alexandria*, in Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world. It was dedicated to the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts and aimed to compile all the manuscripts available at the time.

In the same way, we also aim to compile in a sigle point-of-access all the scientific publications of our times, and thus we named this technology Alexandria in their honour.


### What is ![Logo of Open Access](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Open_Access_logo_PLoS_white.svg/20px-Open_Access_logo_PLoS_white.svg.png) Open Access?

**Open access (OA)** means unrestricted online access to peer-reviewed scholarly research. Open access is primarily intended for scholarly journal articles, but is also provided for a growing number of theses, book chapters, and scholarly monographs.

### How does Alexandria help me?

First, by allowing you to **easily search through all open access available academic literature**, so you can save time and focus on what you are really passionate about.

But it also help you in other ways:

- Are you a *researcher*? Give the maximum visibility to your work.
- Are you a *research institution*? Showcase your best research, download publications reports, and attract funding.
- Are you a *goverment*? Make research funded by the people, available for the people.
- Are you a *company*? Knowledge transfer partners were never easier to find.
